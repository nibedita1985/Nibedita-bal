## About Me
I am a results-driven Data Scientist with over 5 years of experience in analyzing data and developing machine learning models. My expertise lies in Python, SQL, and statistical analysis, where I have successfully implemented automated reporting systems and contributed to fraud detection projects.In my most recent role at Bank of America, I worked on high-impact projects involving AI-based models to detect and analyze fraud. I developed classification models using XGBoost and Random Forests, achieving over 96% accuracy in fraud prediction while processing over 1 million daily transactions. My efforts in creating automated performance measurement systems have significantly reduced manual review time and improved model performance through A/B testing.
I hold a Master of Science in Data Science from DePaul University, where I graduated with a GPA of 3.7. In addition to my technical skills in machine learning and data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, I am well-versed in big data technologies, including Hadoop and Spark.
