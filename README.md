## About Me
I am a results-driven Data Scientist with over 5 years of experience in analyzing data and developing machine learning models. My expertise lies in Python, SQL, and statistical analysis, where I have successfully implemented automated reporting systems and contributed to fraud detection projects.In my most recent role at Bank of America, I worked on high-impact projects involving AI-based models to detect and analyze fraud. I developed classification models using XGBoost and Random Forests, achieving over 96% accuracy in fraud prediction while processing over 1 million daily transactions. My efforts in creating automated performance measurement systems have significantly reduced manual review time and improved model performance through A/B testing.
I hold a Master of Science in Data Science from DePaul University, where I graduated with a GPA of 3.7. In addition to my technical skills in machine learning and data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, I am well-versed in big data technologies, including Hadoop and Spark.

## Technologies & Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Tools**: Tableau
- **Specialization**: Machine Learning, data analysis

## Current Projects
- [Project 1](#) - Worked in Mastercard, VISA, and CA risk Analytics vendor projects to detect and analyze fraud through AI-based models using cutting-edge ML technologies.
Performed data analysis, data migration, performance monitoring and evaluation, data preparation, graphical presentation, statistical analysis, reporting, validation, and documentation.
Developed fraud detection models with >96% accuracy - Reduced false positives by 35% compared to previous version models - Processing 1M+ daily transactions with <100ms latency.
Created an automated performance measure system with 90% accuracy, which reduced manual review time by 65%. Implemented A/B testing framework, leading to 18% improvement in model performance.
Developed technical documents and reports, and designed data visualizations to communicate complex analysis results.
Worked on various applications using Python integrated IDEs such as Visual Studio Code and Jupyter notebook. Performed data imputation using the Scikit-learn package in Python.                        
Used Python packages and Machine Learning algorithms such as Ggplot2, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Regression, Classification, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests, KNN, and K-Means.

- [Your Project 2](#) - Developed a building energy model for the HVAC system that tracks temperature variance and accurately predicts the future temperature diï¬€erence based on the data logger time series data.
Created actionable insights algorithms for real-time monitoring of building conditions.
Automated light & heat waste calculation and designed the logic structure. Developed algorithms for backend data processing design and automated them to be useful for both teams.
